Everyone uses AI, but nobody understands how it makes decisions. Not even the developers! I find this fascinating and alarming.

As an independent AI safety researcher, I study the internal mechanisms of artificial neural networks to improve control over AI systems and avoid failures. Alessandro Barp (UCL), Ekdeep Singh (Goodfire AI), and David Bau (Northeastern University) advise me.

Previously, I was MATS scholar under Neel Nanda and a visiting researcher in David Bau's lab. I completed my Bachelor's in Physics with Hans J. Briegel at LFU Innsbruck and did internships at CERN, European XFEL, and the Santa Fe Institute.

My whole family does exciting things: Esin promotes sustainability as founder of organic tea brand samova and former vice president of FC St Pauli. Stefan is a yoga teacher and musician at Deutsches Schauspielhaus. Sinan is a specialist for modern energy solutions at Enpal, Germany's leader for solar installations.
